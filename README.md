<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This is Mind Garden, a daily planner that aims to help you start every day grounded and on the right foot. It is very simple by design, as building new habits and overall productivity is destroyed when you overwhelm yourself. As such, there is only one field for your daily goal, as setting too many is a recipie for failure. The point is to keep things lightweight and realistic. Everything you input is saved locally on your browser, so you can leave the page and come back later to check off a task or update your notes. The next morning you can hit the reset button and start again.

## Background

Over the past few years I started journaling and tracking my progress on various areas of my life I am trying to improve on. For example, tracking my time spent coding, going to the gym, my daily steps, losing weight, tracking calories. I attribute a lot of my success on these goals to my tracking. Something I have come to learn is that sometimes the best way to make progress is to keep things simple. Don't go too hard or you'll burn out. I've been there. This application was my attempt to strip everything down and focus on one goal for which your day will have been a success if completed. Nowadays, I routinely code for 6+ hours, I go to the gym at least 3 times a week and walk 10k steps everyday. I count every calorie I eat and I've lost over 100lbs. But it didn't start that way. I struggled very much with each of these goals (except maybe coding, since I find it fun), but once I learned that me going to the gym for 2 hours 7 days a week would last all of 4 days followed by nothing for at least a month, it all clicked. My goal became just to walk to the gym, at which point I always felt like I had to go once I was there. Building habits take time, and setting too many goals will prevent you from meeting any of them. That's why I feel it is so important to start slow and keep things simple and attainable until they become habits that are engrained.
